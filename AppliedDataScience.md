## NumPy:
Use when you need to perform fast numerical computations on large, homogeneous arrays, especially for mathematical operations.

**Use Cases:**
***
* Machine learning (data preprocessing, model training).
* Scientific computing (simulations, signal processing).
* Image processing (pixel manipulation).

## Pandas:
Use when you need to work with structured, tabular data, and perform operations like filtering, grouping, merging, and reshaping.

**Use Cases**
***
* Data cleaning and preparation.
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Data wrangling and transformation.
* Feature engineering for machine learning.
