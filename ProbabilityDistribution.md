A **Probability Distribution (PD)** is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range.

**Types of PDs**

    1. Binomial Distribution
    2. Poisson Distribution
    3. Normal Distribution
    4. Bernoulli Distribution

**Probabality Functions**

    1. Density Function
    2. Mass Function
    3. Cumulative Distribution Function
