## Probability Distribution
Probability is the chance occuring an event. Its measured between 0 and 1. 0 means no chance , 1 means high chance of happening an event.
e.g., Flipping of Coin, Chance of Rain, Chance for a Party to win in an election


A **Probability Distribution (PD)** is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range.

Based on principles of Bernoulli Trials, there two types of PDs.

1. Binomial Distribution
2. Poisson Distribution
