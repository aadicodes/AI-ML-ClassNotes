# Probability theory 
is a branch of mathematics that studies the likelihood of different outcomes from uncertain events, essentially providing a mathematical framework to analyze randomness and quantify the chance of something happening, where the probability of an event is a number between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain). This was developed during 17th to 19th centuries. 

The first step in DataScience is "Exploring Data "
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is relatively new area of Statistics

Classical Statistics are focused on Inference.

EDA has evolved beyond its original scope due to rapid development of new technology, access to big data and use of quantitative analysis. 

Statistics as  a discipline entails below steps
1. Collection
2. Preparation
3. Analysis
4. Interpretation

Common Statistical Terms
* Population
* Sample
* Measurement
* Sample Data
* Parameter : A statistical measure that describes a character of the population
* Statistic : describes the characteristic of a sample.
* Variable
* Distribution
  
Descriptive Statistics : A branch of Statistics that involve organizing, displaying and describing data.
Inferential Statistics : A branch of Statistics that draws conclusions about Population, based on information obtained from the sample taken from that Population
Qualitative Data : Data that is not numerical but categorical such as labels, attributes etc.
Quantitative Data : Numerical in nature and belongs to a Numerical Scale. 

E.g. , 
Mileage per Gallon from a Car = Characteristic of a sample
Average Mileage of all Cars = Parameter (for Car Population)
Avg. life of a sample is statistic


## TYPES of Statistics : 
1. Descriptive Statistics : A branch of Statistics that involve organizing, displaying and describing data, used to describe a Data set features, also involves calculating a statistic for a sample
2. Inferential Statistics : Methods that enable estimation of one or more characteristics of a population. Facilitates making a decision on a population based its sample results. Data is taken from samples to make generalizations about Population. 
3. Predictive Statistics : Science of extracting information from data and using them to predict Trends, behavior patterns and relationships between characteristics
	Eg., Using Data from number of residents in a city recorded over years, Predicting City's future population and hence the demand for new infrastructure.

## Data Categorization
1. Qualitative Data (or Categorical)
2. Quantitative Data
Data is typically categorized for statistical analysis based on its measurement scale, primarily into two main groups: categorical (qualitative) data, which describes categories or groups, and quantitative data, which represents numerical values that can be measured or counted; further divisions within these categories include nominal, ordinal, discrete, and continuous data depending on the level of measurement and the characteristics of the data itself.

## Key points about data categorization:
• Categorical data:
• Nominal: Represents categories with no inherent order (e.g., hair color - brown, black, blonde). 
• Ordinal: Represents categories with a natural order, but the difference between categories may not be consistent (e.g., T-shirt size - small, medium, large). 
• Quantitative data:
• Discrete: Represents countable values with distinct gaps between them (e.g., number of siblings). 
• Continuous: Represents measurable values that can take on any value within a range (e.g., height). 
Example of data categorization:
• Survey question:
"What is your favorite color?"
• Categorical (Nominal): Blue, Green, Red, Yellow 
• Data point:
"Number of customers in a store on a given day"
• Quantitative (Discrete): 25, 30, 18


## Measures of Central Tendency
Mean, Median and Mode

## Measures of Dispersion
* Standard Deviation (SD)
* Random Variables
* Sets
