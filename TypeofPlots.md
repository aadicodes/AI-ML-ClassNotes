### Line Plot
	A line graph drawn on x/y axis ,e.g timeseries data plotted on a graph
### Marker Plot
	Individual data points shown on x/y axis and used for smaller data sets
### Scatter Plots
	Bunch of datapoints shown on a x/y axis , looks like dense stars
### Area Plot
	An area shaded with different colors , useful for cumulative totals
### Bar Plots
	Rectangular graphs that show vertical or horizontal bars aka Bar chart
	
### Histogram Chart or Plot
	Divide datasets into bins and represent the frequency of each bin with bars.

A bar chart is used to compare discrete categories of data, where each bar represents a distinct category, while a histogram displays the distribution of continuous data by grouping values into ranges (called bins), with no gaps between bars, allowing you to see how data is spread across a range of values; essentially, a bar chart compares categories, while a histogram shows the frequency distribution of a single variable within a range

### Pie Chart


### NumPy:

Generally faster for numerical computations on large datasets due to its lower-level implementation and optimized array operations.
###  Pandas:

May be slower for large datasets, especially when performing complex operations, due to its higher-level abstractions and additional functionality.

### Use Cases:
• NumPy:
Ideal for mathematical and scientific computations, machine learning algorithms, and working with numerical data in general.
• Pandas:
Geared towards data analysis, data cleaning, data wrangling, and working with structured data in a user-friendly way.
	In Summary:
	• NumPy: Low-level, high-performance numerical operations on arrays.
	• Pandas: High-level, flexible data manipulation and analysis tools.
	Which one to use:
	• For mathematical operations on numerical data: NumPy
	• For data analysis and manipulation: Pandas
	• Often, you'll use both: NumPy for the underlying calculations, and Pandas for the convenient data structures and manipulation tools.

### Summary of ESSENTIALS OF PYTHON PROGRAMMING

NumPy => Numerical Python , enables computaion in Linear algebra , its used in combination with SciPy and Matplotlib , that replaces Matlib.

Pandas = > Panel Data (reference from econometrics), used for data wrangling, manipulation and export to various formats like csv and json, handles timeseries data

SciPy => Scientific Python , built on top of NumPy. Tailor-made for engineering and Scientific apps
Uses a multi dimensional array

Statsmodels => library with Statistical Models, this covers statistical tests, plotting functions, descriptive statistics etc
Eg. Linear regression, ANOVA, Time series Analysis, Statistical Tests , Graphics.

INTRO to stats models:
Its built on top of SciPy and NumPy.
