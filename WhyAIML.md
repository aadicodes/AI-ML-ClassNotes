# Why AI ML and Why now ? 
## Why a person with 20 years of computer programming experience shall learn AI/ ML ?
As someone with 20 years of computer programming experience, delving into Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can be incredibly beneficial. Let me highlight a few compelling reasons:
1. Revolutionary Technology: AI is more than just a buzzword; itâ€™s a revolutionary technology transforming how we work, live, and interact. With the explosion of data and the need to make sense of it, the demand for AI skills is skyrocketing1.
2. Career Opportunities: Learning AI and ML opens up exciting career opportunities. As an AI engineer or ML specialist, you can work on cutting-edge projects, contribute to research, and create innovative solutions2.
3. Data-Driven Decision Making: AI enables data-driven decision-making. By understanding ML algorithms, you can build predictive models, analyze patterns, and extract valuable insights from data.
4. Automation and Efficiency: AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up your time for more creative and strategic work. Imagine building chatbots, recommendation systems, or self-driving cars!
5. Stay Ahead of the Curve: In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, staying updated is crucial. AI and ML are at the forefront of innovation, and learning them ensures you stay relevant and competitive.
6. Cross-Disciplinary Skills: AI bridges computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific knowledge. Itâ€™s a chance to expand your skill set and collaborate across disciplines.
7. Business Impact: AI is transforming industriesâ€”healthcare, finance, marketing, and more. Understanding AI allows you to contribute to solving real-world problems.
Remember, AI encompasses various subfields, including natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and more. Start by exploring the basics, then dive deeper into specific areas that interest you. Whether youâ€™re building recommendation engines, analyzing medical images, or creating AI-powered art, the possibilities are vast! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
